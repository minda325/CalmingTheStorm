I am a mother of two creative children. Homeschool Mom, Piano Teacher, and Housekeeper are a few of the many jobs that I take on in my daily life.  I love nature and strive to be involved in taking care of the environment.  I have an almost unhealthy obsession with Tiny Homes and Coffee.  I live a Gluten Free lifestyle due to an allergy. My whole front yard is also a garden.  I am a Buddhist Unitarian Universalist.  *[sgi-usa.org](sgi-usa.org)
